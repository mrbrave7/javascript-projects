# What Is Dynamic Form Validator
A dynamic form validator refers to a validation mechanism that adjusts its rules or conditions based on user input or external factors, providing real-time feedback. Unlike static form validation, which applies fixed rules, dynamic validation allows the validation logic to change or evolve during the form-filling process, depending on the data entered.
